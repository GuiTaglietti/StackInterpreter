# Stack interpreter

Stack interpreter is a project that was requested as the final project of computer architecture and organization in computer science degree.
I liked so much the base idea and decided to go a bit more far than the simple console aplication, using QTCreator for the GUI and to develop a desktop aplication.
I also did the console aplication, but of course, i made a QT desktop aplication and a web version with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Special thanks to Marcos Jos√© Brusso, mastermind of the discipline. He helped me a lot on every single question, for sure i've learned a lot doing all this stuff!
